			 <h2>Rise Against Hunger</h2>
			 <p3>We rise by lifting others. We know that a peaceful world cannot exist one-third rich and two-thirds hungry. If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one. You pray for the hungry.</p3>

					 <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
					 <p>Most people think about charity the altruistic intentions behind its creation. They think that the founder wanted to improve the world. While I think that this is true in nearly every case, there are also other strong motivations and sometimes these can interfere with or even supersede the organisation’s stated mission.</p>

					<h2>MAKE DONATIONS</h2>
					<p>Though our donations are made to please ourselves, we insist, upon those who receive our alms being pleased with them. Value of life depends not on your possessions, but on your donation. We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give. Kindness in words creates confidence.</p>

					<h2>HELP & SUPPORT</h2>
					<p>No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.” “There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up.” “When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed.” “You have not lived today until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.</p>

We have a bold vision: graduating healthy, educated, empowered and employed young adults from our program so they can achieve the goal of breaking the cycle of poverty.</p>
